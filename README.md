contestor is a bot that enters twitter competitions. Built with python, he strives to be the very best. Still a work in progress, although the base functions do work.

##what it does

contestor pulls the latest tweets with some fancy search terms geared towards giveaways, retweets them and then follows the original tweeter. Also, if the world "like" or "favorite" or some variaiton is mentioned in the tweet, contestor will also like/favorite the tweet. The goal here is to enter as many twitter competitions as possible.
